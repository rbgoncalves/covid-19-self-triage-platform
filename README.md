### 💥 Problem

SNS24 call centers don't have enough infrastructure for the triage of potentially infected persons (and the same it's true for all other kinds of diseases and accidents, because they still happen :/)

### 👨‍🔬Proposed solution

Reduce the SNS24 call centers bottleneck in order to increase the service availability so that there is more room to handle critical situations.
For that, I suggest the creation of a platform where people can do some self-assessment (Just like one of these https://www.811healthline.ca/covid-19-self-assessment/are-you-experiencing-any-of-the-following/ , https://public.ehealthsask.ca/sites/COVID-19/ ) and by the end of the quiz (if suspicious), instead of showing some generic message saying "Call 911 or see your doctor", the platform classifies (within the suspicious cases) each person by severity. Sharing that data with some medical entity, e.g. sending an email to atendimento@sns24.gov.pt and telling to the people that they ill be reached ASAP.
With that, we are creating a kind of pipeline that could help SNS24 to filter and prioritize suspicious cases by severity, taking a nice load from the call centers.
